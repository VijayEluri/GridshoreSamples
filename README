Welcome to my small projects project. In here I will create samples that are to small to be a project on their own.

The following projects are available:

* FirstStepsHibernateSearch - A very easy Curriculum Vitea application that shows the hibernate search capabilities.
* SpringMobileSample - A very basic sample using the spring mobile project
* groovy-es-client - Some ideas and tryouts for playing with elastic search using groovy
